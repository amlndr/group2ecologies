        <h2>About The Fulmars</h2>
        <p>In 2020, over 86% of 98 investigated fulmars were found with plastic 
          inside their digestive system. Where over 40% contain over 0.1 gr of 
          plastic, endangering their health. As the biomonitor of marine litter, 
          the UK and EU targets to reduce to 10% of fulmars with more than 0.1 gram 
          of plastic by 2074, as its acceptable threshold. As plastic production 
          escalates, can they reach their target?</p>
          
          <p>Furthermore, <b>unable to differentiate plastic from food, fulmars tend to
            forage on the surface water and are likely to capture microplastic instead.
          </b>As parents, the fulmar feed (or transfer) plastic to their fledglings.
          As the fledgling grew up and have a child of their own, it is likely 
          that they will also feed plastic to their own fledglings.
          
          As in any living creatures, digesting plastic is not healthy. It can cause 
          tearing inside their body, plastic chemicals absorbed into their body, and much more.
           Hence, shortening their lifespan.</p>
           <h2>Our Goal</h2>
           <p>And so, we would like to show you the brutal realities of fulmars and their
           future generations. <b>Must their future generations suffer the same grim fate?</b>
          
            <p>With Maru Mori, you can explore the changes of these 
            98 investigated fulmars on the occurrence of plastic found inside 
            the fulmars that are illustrated through suspended lights. </p>

            <h2><b>How to interact?</b></h2>
            <p>First, take a look at the gear and explore.</p>
            <p>Then, try and turn the outer gear which represents
              the years.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, look up and see the light color changes!</p>

        <h2>About The Fulmars</h2>
        <p>In 2020, over 86% of 98 investigated fulmars were found with plastic 
          inside their digestive system. Where over 40% contain over 0.1 gr of 
          plastic, endangering their health. As the biomonitor of marine litter, 
          the UK and EU targets to reduce to 10% of fulmars with more than 0.1 gram 
          of plastic by 2074, as its acceptable threshold. As plastic production 
          escalates, can they reach their target?</p>
          
          <p>Furthermore, <b>unable to differentiate plastic from food, fulmars tend to
            forage on the surface water and are likely to capture microplastic instead.
          </b>As parents, the fulmar feed (or transfer) plastic to their fledglings.
          As the fledgling grew up and have a child of their own, it is likely 
          that they will also feed plastic to their own fledglings.
          
          As in any living creatures, digesting plastic is not healthy. It can cause 
          tearing inside their body, plastic chemicals absorbed into their body, and much more.
           Hence, shortening their lifespan.</p>
           <h2>Our Goal</h2>
           <p>And so, we would like to show you the brutal realities of fulmars and their
           future generations. <b>Must their future generations suffer the same grim fate?</b>
          
            <p>With Maru Mori, you can explore the changes of these 
            98 investigated fulmars on the occurrence of plastic found inside 
            the fulmars that are illustrated through suspended lights. </p>

            <h2><b>How to interact?</b></h2>
            <p>First, take a look at the gear and explore.</p>
            <p>Then, try and turn the outer gear which represents
              the years.

            <p>Finally, look up and see the light color changes!</p>

        <p>Based on the chart above, we want our user to understand how their actions can have
          consequences towards nature. Although nature always evolve at a slower pace, 
          humans make the change go at a faster rate. And that is what we want our user to feel,
          and be mindfully curious on how their action can impact nature and its surroundings,
          including humans.<br><br>
          Below is our artefact and how the interaction works.

        <h1>We have experimented on various ways to implement our idea.</h1>
        <p>Here's a preview of what we've done so far and how we iterated our idea.</p>

            <p>Here we try to experiment on how the planks would behave under the offset
              axis circles we made.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>V1</h3>
            <p>Since the previous one won't stay put, we changed the design and added a 
            small dent below the circles so that the plank would stay put.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">

          <div class="column">
            <h3>V2</h3>
            <p>Satisfied with our plank design experiment, we wanted to 
              create something organic and one that would flow as one unit 
              to mimic the water's waves. Here we try to use different sizes of
              circles but it didn't move smoothly.
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="column">
            <h3>V3</h3>
            <p>We then changed the circles to all have the same size like in 
              version 0, and it works great. We also added dents underneath the 
              organic shape to keep she organic shapes in place.

            <p><b>The Organic Shape</b><br>
            Inspired by the Surfbench created by Kim André Lange,
            we used the shape and fit it in a row to help make a wave-like motion. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='column'>
            <img src='1_tusuksate.jpg'width=70% height=70% id='im'/>
            <p><b>The Actuator</b><br>
            By using 1 actuators and have circles put on it in an offset position,
            this is what makes the wave motion.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='column'>
            <img src='1_dent.jpg'width=70% height=70% id='im'/>
            <p><b>The Stabilizer</b>
            <br>To make the organic shape into place, we use 3 card boards, with the 
            one in the middle have bits of its parts cut out to fit into the circle.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h1>We also tested our electronics, using a pressure sensor and a grove motor shield
          with an arduino.
        </h1>
        <p>The pressure sensor and the grove motor shield each have their own arduino, connected
          with wires to communicate to each other. Where the grove motor shield is the client and
        the pressure sensor as the server.<br>
        below is the diagram on how it works.
        </p>
        <img src='diagram.png' width='800'/>
        <p>Next we programmed the artefact so that when a person puts a cup on the pressure 
          sensor, it can detect how much water is in the cup, and it will make the artefact 
        to start moving in accordance to its weight. Where the less water, the faster the actuator moves.</s> </p>
      <p>Below is the video of our programming tests with the artefact.</p> 
      <video width="300"muted controls>
        <source src="exp.Mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <p>Our program worked with 100% functionality. The issues lies more on the friection created
        by the organic shape and the actuator itself.
      </p>
      <h1>Though far from perfect, this artefact is a reminder that not
        all changes can be seen.
